All the instructions about the coursework is given in coursework2.ipynb file. For those of you who are not familiar with this type of files, it is a python notebook document, used mostly by Jupyter Notebook. In it, you can code python in cells, while you can also insert formatted texts and visualizations. 

For this coursework you are not going to create any additional report files. You are going to add all your work in the coursework2.ipynb file.  Necessary instructions are given in the notebook.

For this coursework you are going to use only the following libraries:

-numpy==1.21.5
-matplotlib==3.1.3
-pandas==1.0.1
-sklearn==0.22.1

The numbers after the '==' refers to the version. These versions work, however it probably works for the newer versions and some of the older versions as well. These versions are the ones we used to create the homework, and I suggest that you use these versions for compatibility while checking your homeworks, but if you'd like, you can try other versions as well.
change the name of your notebook file to your name and reg number. As usual, send the files to the class coordinator, he will zip them and send me a single compressed folder. work submitted past the deadline won't be accepted. Wish you success.  You are advised to start of the work as early as possible not to wait for the deadline day. The deadline is march 10, 23:59
